🛎️ ⚠️ NEW: Rank-Based Alert System
The bot will auto-tag hunters when rank-specific content becomes available:

🧠 How It Works:
Each rank tier (e.g., E, D, C, B, A, S) has a dedicated role: @Rank_E, @Rank_A, etc.

When a Red Gate, Guild Raid, or Dungeon opens:

The bot checks all players eligible (by rank)

Tags the corresponding role with an embedded alert
