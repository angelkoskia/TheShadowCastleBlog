What to do next:

Confirm the Bot's Stability: Is your bot consistently running and connected to Discord before you try to interact? If it's frequently restarting or disconnecting, this is the first issue to tackle.
Look for Other Errors: When you click an interaction and get the "An error occurred..." message, please check your bot's console for any other traceback that occurs at that exact moment, before or instead of the CancelledError. The previous changes I suggested added traceback.print_exc() inside your UI interaction callbacks precisely for this reason. If there's a problem within the logic of HelpView or StatusView, that specific traceback will tell us.
Check Your Internet Connection: Ensure your internet connection is stable if you're running the bot locally.
Review Hosting Environment (if applicable): If you're hosting your bot online, check your hosting provider's logs for any messages about process termination or resource exhaustion.
To help catch any unhandled interaction errors more broadly, you can add a global application command error handler in main.py:

This will catch errors in interactions (like button clicks and select menus) that might slip past individual try-except blocks.

Python

# main.py

# ... (rest of your imports) ...

# Inside your main.py, typically after your bot definition
# and before the main() async function

@bot.tree.error
async def on_app_command_error(interaction: discord.Interaction, error: discord.app_commands.AppCommandError):
    """
    Global error handler for application commands (slash commands, context menus, and UI interactions).
    """
    if interaction.response.is_done(): # If interaction already responded, use followup
        send_func = interaction.followup.send
    else: # Otherwise, use direct response
        send_func = interaction.response.send_message
    
    # Check for specific known errors or log them
    if isinstance(error, discord.app_commands.CommandOnCooldown):
        await send_func(f"This command is on cooldown! Try again in {error.retry_after:.1f} seconds.", ephemeral=True)
    elif isinstance(error, discord.app_commands.MissingPermissions):
        await send_func(f"You don't have the necessary permissions to use this command: {error.missing_permissions}", ephemeral=True)
    elif isinstance(error, discord.app_commands.BotMissingPermissions):
        await send_func(f"I don't have the necessary permissions to complete this action: {error.missing_permissions}", ephemeral=True)
    else:
        # For all other unhandled errors in app commands/interactions
        print(f"[APP_COMMAND_ERROR] Unhandled error in interaction {interaction.command.name if interaction.command else 'unknown'}: {error}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        await send_func("An unexpected error occurred while processing this interaction. Please try again later.", ephemeral=True)

# ... (rest of your bot code) ...
Add this on_app_command_error event to your main.py, restart your bot, and then try interacting again. If an error occurs within the UI, this global handler will catch it and print a more specific traceback to your console.

The most crucial step now is still to provide any other error messages from your console that appear exactly when the interaction fails. This will help differentiate between a bot shutdown issue and a specific bug in your UI code.
