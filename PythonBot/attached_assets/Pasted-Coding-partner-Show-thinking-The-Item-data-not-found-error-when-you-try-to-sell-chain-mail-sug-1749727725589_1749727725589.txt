The "Item data not found!" error when you try to sell "chain mail" suggests that the bot's internal ITEMS dictionary (which you should define in a file like game_data.py) does not contain an entry for "chain mail" with all the necessary details, including a price for selling.

To fix the "Item data not found!" error:

Check game_data.py (or wherever your ITEMS dictionary is):
Ensure there is an item entry with the id exactly matching "chain_mail" (or whatever ID you use internally, e.g., if the display name is "Chain Mail", the ID might be "chain_mail").
Make sure this item entry includes a price dictionary with a sell key, like this:
Python

"chain_mail": {
    "id": "chain_mail",
    "name": "Chain Mail",
    "description": "Basic chain armor.",
    "type": "armor",
    "stats": {"defense": 8},
    "price": {"buy": 120, "sell": 60}, # <--- Ensure 'sell' price is here!
    "stackable": False,
    "equippable": True
},
Verify get_item_data: Double-check that your get_item_data function (from utils/inventory_utils.py or similar) correctly retrieves items from your ITEMS dictionary.
Ensure remove_item_from_inventory is used correctly: The sell_button in InventoryView relies on this helper to remove the item after a successful sale.
Regarding the Interactable Inventory UI
The code I provided in the previous turn, specifically Step 4: Inventory Command with UI, is the interactable inventory UI you're looking for.

This InventoryView class creates an embedded message with:

Pagination buttons (Previous/Next) if your inventory is too large.
A Select dropdown menu where you can choose an item.
Context-sensitive action buttons ("Use", "Equip/Unequip", "Sell") that enable once you select an item from the dropdown.
To implement the interactable UI:

Add InventoryView Class: Make sure the entire InventoryView class (including all @discord.ui.button and @discord.ui.select decorators and their associated methods) is defined in your bot's code. This should be in your main bot file or a dedicated cogs file.

Register the .inventory command: Ensure your @bot.command(name="inventory", aliases=["inv"]) command is correctly set up to create and send an instance of InventoryView.

Python

# Example (from previous response)
@bot.command(name="inventory", aliases=["inv"])
async def inventory(ctx):
    user_id = str(ctx.author.id)
    hunters_data = load_hunters_data() # Ensure this function is correctly imported/defined
    hunter = hunters_data.get(user_id)

    if not hunter:
        await ctx.send("You are not registered as a hunter. Use `.start` to begin your journey!")
        return

    view = InventoryView(ctx, hunter) # Instantiate your interactive view
    embed = view.get_inventory_embed()
    view.message = await ctx.send(embed=embed, view=view) # Send the message with the UI attached
Ensure Imports: Double-check that you have from discord.ui import Button, View, Select at the top of your file where InventoryView is defined.

Once InventoryView is correctly implemented and called by your .inventory command, typing .inventory should present you with a message that includes the interactive buttons and a dropdown menu, allowing you to select and interact with your items.
