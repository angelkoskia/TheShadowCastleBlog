You've hit a common Python asyncio error! The message [ERROR] Interactive combat error: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable combined with the RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'award_exp' was never awaited directly tells us the problem.

Understanding the Error:

'coroutine' object is not subscriptable: This means you're trying to use square brackets [] on something that is an asynchronous function (a coroutine) before it has finished executing. Asynchronous functions, when called, return a coroutine object. To get the result of that function, you need to await it.
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'award_exp' was never awaited: This warning is the smoking gun! It tells us exactly which function is causing the problem. Your award_exp function (likely imported from utils.leveling_system) is an async function, but somewhere in your code, you're calling it without await.
The Solution:

The fix is straightforward: you need to await the award_exp function call.

Let's find the problematic line and correct it.

Located the Issue:

Based on the RuntimeWarning at /home/runner/workspace/main.py:1323, the problem is likely within your combat handling logic where experience is awarded.

Here's the relevant section of your code from main.py (around line 1323 for the RuntimeWarning, and line 1101 for the interactive_battles error, likely in the handle_combat_turn function):

Python

# ... (inside handle_combat_turn or similar combat loop function) ...

        if view.player_action == "attack":
            # Player attacks monster
            # ... (attack calculation logic) ...
            turn_info += f"💥 You attacked the {monster['name']} for {player_damage} damage!\n"
            monster['current_hp'] -= player_damage

            if monster['current_hp'] <= 0:
                turn_info += f"🏆 You defeated the {monster['name']}!"
                hunter['monsters_defeated'] = hunter.get('monsters_defeated', 0) + 1
                
                # Check for daily kill progress
                if 'daily_kills' not in hunter:
                    hunter['daily_kills'] = 0
                hunter['daily_kills'] += 1

                # Award EXP and Gold
                exp_gained = monster['exp_reward']
                gold_gained = monster['gold_reward']
                
                # --- THIS IS LIKELY THE PROBLEM AREA ---
                # The line that needs `await` before award_exp
                level_up_message = award_exp(self.bot, ctx, user_id, exp_gained) # <--- THIS LINE (or similar)
                
                # The error "'coroutine' object is not subscriptable" suggests interactive_battles is affected here too.
                # This could be because award_exp returns a coroutine object instead of modifying the hunter in place
                # or because subsequent code tries to access interactive_battles without it being fully updated.
                
                hunter['gold'] = hunter.get('gold', 0) + gold_gained
                
                turn_info += f"\nYou gained {exp_gained} EXP and {gold_gained} Gold."
                if level_up_message:
                    turn_info += f"\n{level_up_message}"

                # ... (rest of the combat end logic) ...
                
            else:
                # Monster attacks back if not defeated
                # ... (monster attack logic) ...
                turn_info += f"👹 {monster['name']} attacked you for {monster_damage} damage!\n"
                hunter['hp'] -= monster_damage
                
        # ... (rest of the combat turn handling) ...

Here's the corrected code snippet:

Python

# ... (inside handle_combat_turn or similar combat loop function) ...

        if view.player_action == "attack":
            # Player attacks monster
            # ... (attack calculation logic) ...
            turn_info += f"💥 You attacked the {monster['name']} for {player_damage} damage!\n"
            monster['current_hp'] -= player_damage

            if monster['current_hp'] <= 0:
                turn_info += f"🏆 You defeated the {monster['name']}!"
                hunter['monsters_defeated'] = hunter.get('monsters_defeated', 0) + 1
                
                # Check for daily kill progress
                if 'daily_kills' not in hunter:
                    hunter['daily_kills'] = 0
                hunter['daily_kills'] += 1

                # Award EXP and Gold
                exp_gained = monster['exp_reward']
                gold_gained = monster['gold_reward']
                
                # --- CORRECTED LINE ---
                # Await the coroutine to get its result
                level_up_message = await award_exp(self.bot, ctx, user_id, exp_gained) 
                
                hunter['gold'] = hunter.get('gold', 0) + gold_gained
                
                turn_info += f"\nYou gained {exp_gained} EXP and {gold_gained} Gold."
                if level_up_message:
                    turn_info += f"\n{level_up_message}"

                # ... (rest of the combat end logic) ...
                
            else:
                # Monster attacks back if not defeated
                # ... (monster attack logic) ...
                turn_info += f"👹 {monster['name']} attacked you for {monster_damage} damage!\n"
                hunter['hp'] -= monster_damage
                
        # ... (rest of the combat turn handling) ...
Reasoning for the fix:

The award_exp function is defined as an async function (a coroutine) in your leveling_system.py. When you call an async function, it doesn't execute immediately; instead, it returns a coroutine object. To actually run the code inside the async function and get its return value, you must use the await keyword. Without await, you were trying to assign a coroutine object to level_up_message, which then caused issues if any subsequent code tried to treat it like a string or access it with [] (making it "not subscriptable").

By adding await before award_exp(...), you ensure that the experience awarding logic completes and the level_up_message receives the actual string result (or None, if award_exp can return that).

Make sure to apply this change to any other instances where award_exp is called without await in your combat or other relevant functions.
