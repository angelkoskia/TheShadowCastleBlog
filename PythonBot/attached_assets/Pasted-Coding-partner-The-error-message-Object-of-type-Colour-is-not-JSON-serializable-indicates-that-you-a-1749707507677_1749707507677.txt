The error message Object of type Colour is not JSON serializable indicates that you are trying to save a discord.Colour object (or a discord.Color object, which is an alias for discord.Colour) directly into a JSON file. JSON can only store basic data types like strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries. Discord Colour objects are complex objects and cannot be directly saved as JSON.

The JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 158 column 26 (char 5618) suggests that after encountering the Colour serialization issue, your hunters_data.json file (or whatever file you are saving data to) became corrupted. When you next try to load it, the json.load function fails because the file content is no longer valid JSON.

This problem likely arises when you are saving hunters_data (or other persistent data) after a process that involves Discord Embed objects, especially if you try to save the embed's color directly.

To fix this, you need to ensure that any discord.Colour objects (or any other non-JSON serializable objects) are converted to a serializable format (like a hexadecimal string or an integer) before saving them to JSON.

Here's how you can address this:

1. Identify where discord.Colour is being saved:

Look for places in your code where you are:

Calling save_hunters_data(hunters_data) or any other function that saves data to a JSON file.
The data being saved might contain discord.Colour objects, often found within embed.color attributes if you are trying to save full embed structures or custom color settings.
Given the error Error creating event combat channel: Object of type Colour is not JSON serializable, this problem is probably occurring when you try to store configuration related to a newly created channel's embed (like its color) or a user's theme settings that use discord.Colour.

2. Convert discord.Colour to a serializable format before saving:

A discord.Colour object has a value attribute which is an integer representing the RGB color. This integer is JSON serializable.

Recommended Solution:

Modify your save_hunters_data function (and potentially your load_hunters_data function) or the data structure itself to handle discord.Colour objects properly.

Example save_hunters_data modification:

Let's assume your hunters_data might directly contain a color attribute that stores a discord.Colour object (e.g., from get_user_theme_colors).

Python

# Assuming your save_hunters_data function looks something like this:
def save_hunters_data(data):
    # Before saving, iterate through the data and convert Colour objects
    # This is a simplified example; you might need to adjust based on your data structure.
    serializable_data = {}
    for user_id, user_data in data.items():
        serializable_user_data = user_data.copy() # Create a copy to modify
        if 'theme_color' in serializable_user_data and isinstance(serializable_user_data['theme_color'], discord.Colour):
            serializable_user_data['theme_color'] = serializable_user_data['theme_color'].value # Convert to integer
        # Add similar checks for any other fields that might contain Colour objects
        
        serializable_data[user_id] = serializable_user_data

    with open('hunters_data.json', 'w') as f: # Or whatever your file is named
        json.dump(serializable_data, f, indent=4)


# And in your load_hunters_data, you might convert it back if needed:
def load_hunters_data():
    if os.path.exists('hunters_data.json'):
        with open('hunters_data.json', 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            # After loading, convert integers back to Colour objects if needed for bot operations
            for user_id, user_data in data.items():
                if 'theme_color' in user_data and isinstance(user_data['theme_color'], int):
                    data[user_id]['theme_color'] = discord.Colour(user_data['theme_color'])
            return data
    return {}
Where get_user_theme_colors is used:

The utils.theme_utils.get_user_theme_colors function likely returns a discord.Colour object. If the return value of this function is directly stored in hunters_data for later use, that's where the serialization issue will occur.

Make sure that when you retrieve the theme color for saving, you extract its integer value:

Python

# Example: when saving user theme settings to hunters_data
# Instead of:
# hunter_data['theme_color'] = get_user_theme_colors(user_id)
# Do:
theme_color_obj = get_user_theme_colors(user_id)
if isinstance(theme_color_obj, discord.Colour):
    hunter_data['theme_color'] = theme_color_obj.value # Store the integer value
else:
    hunter_data['theme_color'] = theme_color_obj # Store as is (e.g., if it's already an int or string)
3. Clear/Fix the Corrupted JSON File:

Because you received a JSONDecodeError, your hunters_data.json file (or the file causing the error) is likely corrupted.

Option A (If you don't mind losing recent data): Delete hunters_data.json (or rename it as a backup). The bot will then create a new, empty one when it starts.
Option B (If you want to try to recover data): Open hunters_data.json in a text editor. Look for the mentioned line and column (line 158, column 26) and try to manually fix any obvious JSON syntax errors (e.g., missing commas, unclosed brackets, invalid values). This can be tricky.
After implementing the serialization fix in your save_hunters_data logic and potentially clearing the corrupted JSON, the bot should be able to save and load data without this error.
