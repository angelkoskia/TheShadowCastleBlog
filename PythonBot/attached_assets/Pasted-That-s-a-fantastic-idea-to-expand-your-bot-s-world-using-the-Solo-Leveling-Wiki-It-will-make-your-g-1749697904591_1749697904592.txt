That's a fantastic idea to expand your bot's world using the Solo Leveling Wiki! It will make your game much richer and more immersive.

However, there's an important consideration when trying to directly "use" a website like a Fandom Wiki:

Challenges with Directly Using a Wiki:

Web Scraping Complexity: While technically possible to write code that "reads" information from a website (this is called web scraping), it's highly complex for a wiki. Wikis are designed for human readability, not machine parsing. Extracting specific stats like "Boss HP" or "Weapon Attack" from the varying layouts of different wiki pages is very difficult and prone to breaking if the wiki's design changes even slightly.
API Limitations: Fandom Wikis use the MediaWiki platform, which has an API. However, using it effectively for structured game data would still require you to understand how to query it, parse complex JSON/XML responses, and handle various data types. It's often more suited for general content retrieval than specific game stats.
Terms of Service & Copyright: Directly scraping content can violate a website's terms of service. You'd also need to be mindful of copyright if you're pulling large amounts of descriptive text without proper attribution or permission.
Performance: Scraping web pages on the fly during bot operation would be slow and inefficient, potentially leading to timeouts for your commands.
Recommended Approach: Manual Curation and Local Data Files

For a project like this, the most practical, stable, and recommended approach is to manually curate the data you need from the Solo Leveling Wiki and store it in your bot's local JSON files.

This gives you:

Full Control: You decide exactly what data points you need (HP, attack, drops, lore, etc.) and how they are structured.
Accuracy: You ensure the data is correct and formatted exactly as your bot expects.
Stability: Your bot won't break if the wiki's website layout changes.
Performance: Loading data from local files is instant.
How to Implement This:

You'll create or update your existing JSON files (monster_data.json, item_data.json, etc.) with the information you gather from the Solo Leveling Wiki. Then, your bot will load these files at startup and use the structured data directly.

Let's look at examples of how you would structure these JSON files for Solo Leveling content:

Step 1: Create/Update Your Data Files (Manual Process)
You would go to the Solo Leveling Fandom Wiki, look up a boss, weapon, or character, and then manually enter the relevant data into your JSON files.

File: monster_data.json (for bosses/monsters)

Step 2: Load and Use Data in Your Bot (main.py, ui_elements.py)
You are already loading hunters_data.json. You'll use the same json.load() mechanism for your new data files.

Update your main.py and ui_elements.py to load these files:

Python

# main.py (or a separate data_manager.py if you prefer)

import json

# ... (rest of your imports) ...

# Function to load monster data
def load_monster_data():
    try:
        with open('monster_data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("monster_data.json not found. Returning empty dictionary.")
        return {}
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding monster_data.json: {e}")
        return {}

# Function to load item data
def load_item_data():
    try:
        with open('item_data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("item_data.json not found. Returning empty dictionary.")
        return {}
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding item_data.json: {e}")
        return {}

# Function to load character lore data
def load_character_lore_data():
    try:
        with open('character_lore.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("character_lore.json not found. Returning empty dictionary.")
        return {}
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding character_lore.json: {e}")
        return {}

# ... (Rest of your main.py code) ...
How to use this:

Create the JSON files: Save the example JSON content into monster_data.json, item_data.json, and character_lore.json in your bot's root directory.
Populate them: Spend some time Browse the Solo Leveling Wiki and filling in these files with the data you want to use in your game. This is the "manual curation" step.
Add the load_ functions: Include the load_monster_data, load_item_data, and load_character_lore_data functions in your main.py (or a utility file).
Implement commands: Use these load_ functions in your bot's commands (like the example lore command above, or in your hunt command when selecting a monster, or equip command for items) to retrieve the relevant data
