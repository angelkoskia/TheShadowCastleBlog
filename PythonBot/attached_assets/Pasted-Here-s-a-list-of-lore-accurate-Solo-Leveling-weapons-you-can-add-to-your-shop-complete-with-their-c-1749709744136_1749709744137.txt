Here’s a list of lore-accurate Solo Leveling weapons you can add to your shop, complete with their canonical names, types, elemental affinities, and notable stats or abilities based on the webtoon and fandom lore. These are iconic weapons used by characters or dropped by bosses that fit perfectly in a Solo Leveling-themed game or bot shop:

💡 Additional Notes:
Baruka’s Dagger and Kamish’s Wrath are the most iconic named weapons from boss drops in the lore, great for high-tier shop items.

Giant’s Sword is ideal for heavy-hitting melee classes.

Shadow Weapons like Igris’ sword or Iron’s mace symbolize the unique power of Jinwoo’s shadows—great for rare or special shop items.

Accessories like Goblin’s Eye add utility buffs, fitting well into a diverse shop.

For thematic consistency, weapon skills or elemental bonuses should match the lore (wind for Baruka’s dagger, fire for Kamish, etc.).

If you want, I can help write shop descriptions or item stats formulas for these weapons too! Would you like that?

3️⃣ Balancing Stat Formulas (Example)
ATK (Attack Power) Scaling
Base_ATK = Tier_Multiplier × Random(100, 500)
Where Tier_Multiplier:

Common = 1

Rare = 2–3

SR = 4–6

UR = 7–10

Skill Power / Effect Strength
Scale skill damage or buffs by:
Skill_Power = Base_ATK × (0.2 to 0.5) depending on skill rarity.

Durability / Defense (for shields or heavy weapons)
Durability = Base_Def × Tier_Multiplier
Base_Def ~ 200 for Rare, up to 2500 for SR/UR shields

Cooldowns / Skill Usage
Stronger items have longer cooldowns, e.g.:

Common: 10s

Rare: 30s

SR: 60s

UR: 90s+

4️⃣ Example: Baruka’s Dagger Stats & Skill
ATK: Random 1500 - 1700 (SR Tier multiplier ~5 × base 300)

HP Boost: +2000

Precision: +1500

Skill: Slayer of Ice Slayers

Effect: Teleport behind enemy + Wind slash dealing 300–500 damage

Cooldown: 45 seconds
