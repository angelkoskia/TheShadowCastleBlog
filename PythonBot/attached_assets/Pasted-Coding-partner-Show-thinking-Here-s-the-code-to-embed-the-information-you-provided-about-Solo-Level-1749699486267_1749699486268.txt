Here's the code to embed the information you provided about Solo Leveling's game elements.

Since you've given me the text directly, I've extracted the key details for each category (Weapons, Event Monsters/Dungeon Bosses, Gates, Dungeons) and structured them into functions that generate Discord embeds.

You can add these functions to your main.py file, or ideally, create a new file (e.g., cogs/sololeveling_info.py) to organize your bot's commands and then load it as a cog.

Python

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import json
import os
from utils.theme_utils import get_user_theme_colors # Make sure this is correctly imported

# Assume these are available from your existing main.py or utils
# def get_user_theme_colors(user_id):
#     # Placeholder if you haven't implemented themes yet
#     return {'info': 0x3498db, 'success': 0x2ecc71, 'error': 0xe74c3c}

class SoloLevelingInfoCommands(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    def _create_base_embed(self, ctx, title, description=None, color_type='info'):
        user_id = str(ctx.author.id)
        colors = get_user_theme_colors(user_id)
        embed_color = discord.Color(colors.get(color_type, 0x3498db)) # Default to blue if theme color not found

        embed = discord.Embed(
            title=title,
            description=description,
            color=embed_color
        )
        embed.set_footer(text="Information from Solo Leveling Wiki | Data may be simplified.")

# To add these commands to your bot:
# In your main.py file, within your bot's setup (e.g., in an on_ready or setup_hook function), add:
# async def main():
#     # ... other bot setup ...
#     await bot.add_cog(SoloLevelingInfoCommands(bot))
#     # ... await bot.start(token) ...
How to use this code:
Place the code:

Option A (Recommended for organization): Create a new file named sololeveling_info.py inside a cogs folder (e.g., your_bot_folder/cogs/sololeveling_info.py). Copy and paste the entire code block above into this new file.
Option B: Copy and paste the entire code block directly into your main.py file, outside of any existing functions or classes (preferably near the top or in a dedicated "commands" section).
Load the Cog (if using Option A):
If you placed the code in a cogs/sololeveling_info.py file, you need to load this cog in your main.py. Find your async def main(): function (or wherever you set up your bot and its cogs) and add the following line:

Python

# In main.py
async def main():
    # ... existing bot setup ...
    # Load the SoloLevelingInfoCommands cog
    await bot.add_cog(SoloLevelingInfoCommands(bot))
    # ... await bot.start(token) ...
Ensure get_user_theme_colors is accessible:

I've included from utils.theme_utils import get_user_theme_colors at the top of the code. Make sure utils/theme_utils.py exists and contains this function. If it's in a different location or named differently, adjust the import statement.
If you haven't implemented themes yet, you can uncomment the placeholder function for get_user_theme_colors provided in the code comments for testing purposes, but remember to replace it with your actual theme logic later.
Run your bot:
Once integrated, you can use the commands in your Discord server:

.weaponsinfo
.bossinfo
.gatesinfo
.dungeonsinfo
.slquickref (or its aliases .quickref, .slref)
This setup will allow your bot to neatly display the Solo Leveling information you provided in well-formatted Discord embeds.
