already has one and isn't currently hunting. You want to reuse the existing channel if it exists and the user is not in combat, rather than creating a new one each time.

How to fix:
Key idea:
Before creating a new channel, check if a private hunt channel for that user already exists.

If yes, reuse that channel.

If no, create it.

Also track whether the user is currently in combat or idle to prevent overlapping hunts.

Example fix for .hunt:
python
Copy
Edit
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import asyncio

active_hunts = set()  # user IDs currently hunting
user_channels = {}    # user ID -> channel object

async def get_or_create_hunt_channel(ctx):
    guild = ctx.guild
    channel_name = f"{ctx.author.name.lower()}-hunt"

    # Check if user already has a hunt channel in the guild
    existing_channel = discord.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name=channel_name)

    if existing_channel:
        return existing_channel

    # Create new private hunt channel
    overwrites = {
        guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=False),
        ctx.author: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True)
    }
    new_channel = await guild.create_text_channel(channel_name, overwrites=overwrites)
    return new_channel

async def run_hunt(ctx):
    if ctx.author.id in active_hunts:
        await ctx.send("⚠️ You are already on a hunt!")
        return

    # Mark user as active hunting
    active_hunts.add(ctx.author.id)

    try:
        # Get existing or new channel
        channel = await get_or_create_hunt_channel(ctx)

        await channel.send(f"{ctx.author.mention}, your hunt has started!")
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

        # Simulate combat or hunting process here...
        await channel.send("Fighting monsters...")

        # Simulate outcome
        import random
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            gold = random.randint(100, 300)
            xp = random.randint(50, 150)
            await channel.send(f"🎉 You won! Gained {gold} Gold and {xp} XP.")
        else:
            await channel.send("💀 You lost the hunt.")

    finally:
        # Mark hunt as done
        active_hunts.remove(ctx.author.id)


bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=".")

@bot.command()
async def hunt(ctx):
    await run_hunt(ctx)
Explanation:
get_or_create_hunt_channel() checks for a channel named after the user.

If found, it returns that channel instead of creating a new one.

We use a global active_hunts set to track if the user is in combat to prevent multiple simultaneous hunts.

The private channel remains persistent until you decide to delete it manually.

Optional:
If you want to delete the private channel after the hunt, add:

python
Copy
Edit
await asyncio.sleep(10)  # wait before deletion so user can read results
await channel.delete()
But deleting and recreating channels each time usually causes issues. Keeping one channel per user is cleaner.
