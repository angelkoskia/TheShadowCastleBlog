To implement a victory screen with gold and XP after a hunt/dungeon/gate, you'll need to locate the part of your combat logic where the monster's health is checked and it is determined to be defeated. For the boss event join session, the provided code snippets don't include specific boss event or session management, so I can only offer conceptual guidance.

1. Adding a Victory Screen with Gold and XP
You'll need to modify your combat function (e.g., where .attack command logic resides) to check if the monster's HP has dropped to 0 or below.

Conceptual Changes:

Locate Monster Defeat Logic: Find the if monster['hp'] <= 0: condition within your combat command (e.g., .attack).
Calculate Rewards: Determine how much gold and XP the hunter gains. This will depend on the monster's difficulty or type.
Create Victory Embed: Construct a new discord.Embed for the victory message, including the gold and XP.
Award Rewards: Call your award_exp function and update the hunter's gold.
Send Message: Send this victory embed to the private adventure channel.
Here's how you might integrate this into your existing code. This assumes you have a monster dictionary with hp and a hunter dictionary for the player.

Python

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
# Ensure these imports are at the top of your main bot file or dungeon_cog
from utils.leveling_system import award_exp, send_level_up_notification # Assuming this path is correct
from utils.theme_utils import get_user_theme_colors, get_info_embed # For embeds and colors

# ... (your existing bot setup and imports)

# Example placeholder for gold management (you'll need to implement actual gold logic)
def add_gold(hunter_data, amount):
    hunter_data['gold'] = hunter_data.get('gold', 0) + amount
    return hunter_data['gold']

# Inside your combat command (e.g., .attack command handler)
# This snippet assumes 'hunter' and 'monster' dictionaries are available in scope.
# It also assumes 'adventure_channel' (the private combat channel) is passed or retrieved.

@bot.command(name='attack')
async def attack(ctx):
    user_id = str(ctx.author.id)
    hunters_data = load_hunters_data()
    hunter = hunters_data.get(user_id)

    if not hunter or 'dungeon_battle' not in hunter:
        await ctx.send("You are not currently in a battle. Use `.hunt` to start one.")
        return

    # Retrieve the private adventure channel for this user
    adventure_channel_id = hunter.get('private_adventure_channel_id')
    if not adventure_channel_id:
        await ctx.send("Could not find your private adventure channel. Please use `.hunt` again to create or join one.")
        return
    adventure_channel = bot.get_channel(adventure_channel_id)
    if not adventure_channel:
        await ctx.send("Your private adventure channel seems to be gone. Please use `.hunt` again to create a new one.")
        # Optionally, clear the stored channel ID if it's invalid
        hunter['private_adventure_channel_id'] = None
        save_hunters_data(hunters_data)
        return

    # Assuming 'monster' data is part of 'hunter['dungeon_battle']'
    monster = hunter['dungeon_battle']['monster']

    # Your existing attack calculation logic here...
    # For example:
    # hunter_damage = calculate_hunter_damage(hunter)
    # monster_damage = calculate_monster_damage(monster)

    # Apply damage (conceptual)
    # monster['hp'] -= hunter_damage
    # hunter['hp'] -= monster_damage # If monster also attacks back

    # --- Start of Victory Condition Check ---
    if monster['hp'] <= 0:
        # Monster is defeated!
        # Calculate rewards
        xp_gained = monster.get('exp_reward', 50) # Example: monster gives 50 XP
        gold_gained = monster.get('gold_reward', 20) # Example: monster gives 20 gold

        # Award XP
        level_up_message = await award_exp(hunter, xp_gained, adventure_channel) # Pass adventure_channel here
        if level_up_message:
            await adventure_channel.send(level_up_message) # Send level up notification in the channel

        # Award Gold
        new_gold_total = add_gold(hunter, gold_gained)

        # Create victory embed
        user_theme_color = get_user_theme_colors(user_id) # Get user's theme color
        victory_embed = discord.Embed(
            title=f"ðŸŽ‰ Victory! {monster['name']} Defeated!",
            description=f"{ctx.author.mention} bravely defeated the {monster['name']}!",
            color=user_theme_color # Use the theme color
        )
        victory_embed.add_field(name="âœ¨ XP Gained", value=f"+{xp_gained} XP", inline=True)
        victory_embed.add_field(name="ðŸ’° Gold Gained", value=f"+{gold_gained} Gold", inline=True)
        victory_embed.add_field(name="Total Gold", value=f"{new_gold_total} Gold", inline=False)
        victory_embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://i.imgur.com/example_victory_image.png") # Optional: Add a victory image
        victory_embed.set_footer(text="Your adventure continues!")

        await adventure_channel.send(embed=victory_embed)

        # Clean up battle state
        del hunter['dungeon_battle']
        save_hunters_data(hunters_data)
        
        # If complete_raid function was deleting the channel, ensure it no longer does this.
        # If you still call it, make sure the channel deletion logic is removed from inside complete_raid.
        # For permanent channels, you should *not* call any function that deletes the channel here.
        # await dungeon_cog.complete_raid(ctx, user_id, True) # Example: if still used for other post-raid logic
        return # End combat turn

    # --- End of Victory Condition Check ---

    # Your existing code for if monster is NOT defeated (e.g., displaying current stats, etc.)
    # Make sure these messages also go to adventure_channel
    # await adventure_channel.send(embed=combat_update_embed) # Example

    # Save hunter data after turn
    save_hunters_data(hunters_data)

Remember to update:

monster data: Ensure your monster data includes exp_reward and gold_reward fields.
add_gold function: Implement this function based on how you manage currency.
save_hunters_data and load_hunters_data: As discussed in the previous turn, ensure these functions handle discord.Colour objects correctly by converting them to integers before saving and potentially back to Colour objects after loading.
Channel deletion logic: Ensure that your dungeon_cog.complete_raid (or any other cleanup function) no longer deletes the private_adventure_channel if you intend for them to be permanent.
2. Boss Event Join Session (1 Minute)
Implementing a "1-minute join session" for boss events requires a more complex system, as it involves:

Event Initiation: A command or trigger to start a boss event announcement.
Timed Join Period: A mechanism to allow users to join within a specific timeframe (e.g., 1 minute).
Lobby Management: Tracking which users have joined the event.
Event Start: Kicking off the actual boss encounter after the join period.
The current 123.txt snippets do not show any existing framework for such public, timed events. You would need to create a new module or set of functions to manage this.

Conceptual Implementation Steps:

Define a BossEvent State: Create a global dictionary or object to hold the state of an ongoing boss event (e.g., is_active, start_time, joined_players, boss_type).
start_boss_event Command:
This command would initiate the event.
It would set BossEvent.is_active = True and record the BossEvent.start_time.
It would send an announcement to a designated channel (e.g., SYSTEM_CHANNEL_ID) informing players about the boss event and how to join (e.g., .join_boss).
It would schedule a task (using asyncio.sleep and then a callback) to automatically close the join session after 1 minute.
join_boss Command:
This command would allow players to join the active boss event.
It would check BossEvent.is_active and if the current time is within the 1-minute join window.
If valid, it would add the user to BossEvent.joined_players.
begin_boss_encounter Function:
This function would be called automatically after the 1-minute join session ends.
It would take all joined_players and move them into the boss encounter (e.g., create a temporary channel for the group, or start a group combat instance).
This is a significant feature that would require substantial new code beyond simple modifications.
