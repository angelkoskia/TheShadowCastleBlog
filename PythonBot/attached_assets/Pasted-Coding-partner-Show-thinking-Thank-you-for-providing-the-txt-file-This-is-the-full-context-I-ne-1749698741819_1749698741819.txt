Thank you for providing the ...txt file! This is the full context I needed.

After reviewing your main.py (from the ...txt file), I've identified the specific area within the handle_combat_turn function that needs adjustment to correctly display the monster defeat message, including XP and gold gained.

The issue is that the turn_info is indeed being updated with the defeat message and rewards, but the final embed update with await view.message.edit() for the monster defeat scenario is not explicitly being called in a way that incorporates all the accumulated turn_info for that specific, final message. The turn_info is primarily being used for the next turn's embed or for the general combat flow, not necessarily for the conclusive "monster defeated" message.

Also, the turn_info accumulation could be a bit clearer, especially right at the point of monster defeat.

Here's the corrected and improved handle_combat_turn function. I've added comments to highlight the changes:

Summary of Changes and Why They Fix the Issue:

Centralized turn_info and Final Update:

Previously, the turn_info was built up, but the crucial final await view.message.edit() after a monster's defeat might have been missed or overwritten by a subsequent turn update.
Now, immediately after monster['current_hp'] <= 0: (and after awarding EXP/Gold, and updating hunter['gold']), I've explicitly added the XP and Gold message to turn_info.
Crucially, a dedicated final_embed = view.create_combat_embed(hunter, monster, turn_info) and await view.message.edit(embed=final_embed, view=view) is called right there within the if monster['current_hp'] <= 0: block. This ensures that the message is edited one last time with the complete, final combat log.
The return statement then correctly exits the handle_combat_turn function, preventing any further updates for that specific combat.
I've also added view.combat_ended = True and view.disable_all_buttons() just before this final update to ensure the view correctly reflects the end state.
State Management for interactive_battles:

Ensured that hunter['hp'] and hunter['mp'] are consistently read from and written back to current_battle['hunter'] within the interactive_battles dictionary. This keeps the in-memory state synchronized for each turn.
The save_hunters_data(hunters_data) call is strategically placed after the hunter and monster data are fully updated, but before the view.stop() and return in the defeat scenario, guaranteeing data persistence.
Refined hunt command loop:

The while not view.combat_ended: loop in the hunt command is now more robust. It calls handle_combat_turn and explicitly checks if view.combat_ended: break to ensure the loop terminates correctly. This prevents the handle_combat_turn from being called again after combat has concluded.
Error Handling for on_command_error: I added traceback.print_exc() to your on_command_error handler. This is very helpful for debugging, as it prints the full error stack to your console, giving you more information than just the error message itself.

By implementing these changes, your bot should now provide clear, real-time feedback to the user upon a monster's defeat, showing the XP and Gold gained directly in the combat log!
